## Assumptions for running regressions

Linear Regression Assumptions 

- Normality of predictors (Shapiro Wilkes test)
- Consistency of residual variance within predictors (Levene's test)


```{r Openness}
# Normality of predictors
# shapiro wilkes test will test for skewedness 
# shapiro.test() 
# should be non-significant (there is no skewedness)

# Openness Measure
shapiro.test(data$openness)

data %>% 
     ggplot()+
     geom_density(aes(openness))


# Le



```





```{r Homoscedasticity}
# The residual variance within predictor variables should be constant
# Levene's Test

```

If these are violated then we can use Robust Regression methods (Bootstrapping)

# Hypothesis 1 - Positive relationship between trait openness and overall CTN.

```{r H1 }
#Linear regression predicting openness from CTN
#CTN ~ Openness 

# lm() to run the linear regression

# Anova() to calculate the variance accounted for by CTN

# calc.relimpo() to calculate the unique variance & effect size (Beta sq) 



```
